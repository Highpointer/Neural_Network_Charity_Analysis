# Neural Network Charity Analysis • • • • •  ⚫
## Overview of the Analysis

This report presents machine learning and neural networks analysis of over 34,000 lines of data to create a binary classifier capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

⚫ Data Preprocessing

The following variable is considered as the target of the analysis:

• <b>IS_SUCCESSFUL</b> - whether or not the money was used successfully

The following variables are considered as the features of the analysis:

• <b>APPLICATION_TYPE</b> - Alphabet Soup application type

• <b>AFFILIATION</b> — Affiliated sector of industry

• <b>CLASSIFICATION</b> — Government organization classification

• <b>USE_CASE</b> — Use case for funding

• <b>ORGANIZATION</b> — Organization type

• <b>STATUS</b> — Active status

• <b>INCOME_AMT</b> — Income classification

• <b>SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS</b> — Special consideration for application

• <b>ASK_AMT</b> — Funding amount requested

The following variables are neither targets nor features and are being removed fronm the input analysis:

• <b>EIN</b> - Unique identification number

• <b>NAME</b> — Name of donor
